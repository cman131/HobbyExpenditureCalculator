This is for the <a href='https://github.com/intuit-recruiting/hackathon/wiki/Hack-Into-It-Challenge-Information'>Intuit hackathon</a> from 9/18/15 at 8pm until 9/19/15 at 10am.


Unfortunately, this project did not go very well. Here is a link to our "planning" document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t-QIgcg3z94H_ZnoVy2-51cRBtwcy6WlOPd3ySKWnpo/edit?usp=sharing

and some of the pictures are in the issues. We did however find this to be a very interesting and fun hackathon.

<h3>Remaining issues</h3>
We hit our time limit, but here are the known issues we were dealing with in the end:
<ul>
<li>Results not being properly displayed in the results pane for buying a home</li>
<li>Does not validate inputs</li>
</ul>
